Introductory material into using the GROMACS simulation package by Justin A. Lemkul (Ph.D., Virginia Tech Department of Biochemistry)

There are currently seven tutorials available:
1. Lysozyme in Water: The intent of this tutorial is to give new users a basic introduction into the tools used to prepare, run, and perform simple analysis on a "typical" system with GROMACS.
2. KALP15 in DPPC: This tutorial is more advanced, and is designed for more experienced users who want to simulate membrane proteins and understand force field structure and modification.
3. Umbrella Sampling: Also somewhat advanced, this tutorial is intended for users who wish to learn to use umbrella sampling to calculate the potential of mean force (PMF) along a single, linear degree of freedom.
4. Biphasic Systems: The construction of a biphasic cyclohexane-water system.
5. Protein-Ligand Complex: The fifth tutorial instructs the user on how to deal with a protein-ligand system, with a focus on proper ligand parametrization and topology handling.
6. Free Energy of Solvation: This tutorial describes the procedure for carrying out a simple free energy calculation, the elimination of van der Waals interactions between a simple molecule (methane) and water. More complicated systems are discussed.
7. Virtual Sites: This tutorial guides the user through manual construction of virtual sites for a very simple linear, triatomic molecule (CO2).
